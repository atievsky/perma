      <h2 class="body-ah">Why should lawyers and law firms use cite.law?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">Link rot ruins citations in briefs and other court filings. It also harms links in blog posts, white papers and any materials used to attract and inform clients. If law firms are using links, they should be concerned about link rot.</p>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Trusted by courts and lawyers</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Many state and federal courts rely on cite.law to protect links in their opinions, and lawyers have used Perma in briefs filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, in multiple U.S. Courts of Appeals and in state appellate courts across the country. Perma also has been relied on by the Law Library of Congress, the Department of Justice and the ABA, and Perma links are encouraged by the Bluebook.<p class="body-text">

      <h3 class="body-bh">Paid option now available</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Right now, individual lawyers can use cite.law on a limited basis, for free, to protect up to 10 links per month. For those who need to protect more links, we now offer unlimited usage through paid subscriptions. Paid subscriptions are $500 per month for firms with at least 100 lawyers and $300 per month for firms with fewer than 100 lawyers.
